# modelling_tank_wall_reflections

This is a collection of functions which can be used to model the expected acoustic signal at a receiver placed in a rectangular tank given a signal produced at a source within the tank. The method of images is used to calculate the various possible reflection paths. 

The file `tank_propagation_example.m` provides a simple example use case, in which the expected received signals are computed for several different source waveforms with a fixed receiver and source geometry.
